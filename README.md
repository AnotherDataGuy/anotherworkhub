`anotherworkhub` is a GEN-AI powered assistant designed to better understand and improve written text.

`anotherworkhub` relies on [Shiny app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiny_(software)) infrastructure and implements API calls to GPT models. Under the hood, `anotherworkhub` relies on packages such as [{golem}](https://engineering-shiny.org/golem.html), [{shinydashboard}](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/get_started.html), [{dplyr}](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and [{shinymanager}](https://datastorm-open.github.io/shinymanager/).

1. **Pitch Improver**: Refine your professional pitch with **real-time feedback** on structure, clarity, and grammar. Whether you're preparing for a presentation, networking event, or job application, this tool ensures your pitch is polished and effective.

2. **Interview Simulator**: Simulate realistic job interview scenarios with **interactive mock interviews**. Customize the format, questions, and settings to mirror your upcoming interviews, helping you practice and prepare with confidence.
